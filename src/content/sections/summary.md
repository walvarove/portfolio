Hello! I'm Álvaro, a programming enthusiast with a passion for best practices.

I would describe myself as a "backend developer", but my true passion lies in designing and writing code that is as scalable, maintainable, and efficient as possible. That's why practices and/or patterns like DDD, Hexagonal Architecture, Testing, etc. are part of my daily work. I always prefer to invest a little more time in writing robust yet flexible code, rather than spending time fixing errors.
